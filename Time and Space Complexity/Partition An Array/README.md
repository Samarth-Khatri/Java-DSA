# Partition An Array

1. You are given an array(arr) of integers and a pivot.
2. You have to re-arrange the given array in such a way that all elements smaller or equal to pivot lie on the left side of pivot and all elements greater than pivot lie on its right side.
3. You have to achieve this in linear time.
