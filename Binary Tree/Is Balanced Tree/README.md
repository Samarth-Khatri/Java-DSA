# Is Balanced Tree

1. You are given a partially written BinaryTree class.
2. You are required to check if the tree is balanced. A binary tree is balanced if for every node the gap between height's of it's left and right subtree is not more than 1.
3. Input is managed for you. 

Note -> Please refer the question video for clarity.

## Constraints
Time complexity must be O(n)  
Space should not be more than required for recursion (call-stack)

## Format
### Input
Input is managed for you.

### Output
true if the tree is balanced, false otherwise

## Example
### Sample Input

21  
50 25 12 n n 37 30 n n 51 n n 75 62 60 n n 70 n n n

### Sample Output
