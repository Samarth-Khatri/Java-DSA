# Is A Binary Search Tree

1. You are given a partially written BinaryTree class.
2. You are required to check if the tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST) as well. In a BST every node has a value greater than all nodes on it's left side and smaller value than all node on it's right side.
3. Input is managed for you. 

Note -> Please refer the question video for clarity.

## Constraints
Time complexity must be O(n)  
Space should not be more than required for recursion (call-stack)

## Format
### Input
Input is managed for you.

### Output
true if the tree is a BST, false otherwise

## Example
### Sample Input

15  
50 25 12 n n 37 n n 75 62 n n 87 n n

### Sample Output
true
