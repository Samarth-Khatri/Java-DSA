# Iterative Depth First Traversal

1. You are given a graph, and a source vertex.
2. You are required to do a iterative depth first traversal and print which vertex is reached via which path, starting from the source.

Note -> For output, check the sample output and question video. Iterative depth first traversal should mimic "Reverse preorder" i.e. nbr with highest value should be visited first and should be printed on the way down in recursion.
