<div>
  <ul>
    <li>You are given a number n1, representing the size of array a1.</li>
<li>You are given n1 numbers, representing elements of array a1.</li>
<li>You are given a number n2, representing the size of array a2.</li>
<li> You are given n2 numbers, representing elements of array a2.</li>
<li> The two arrays represent digits of two numbers.</li>
<li> You are required to find the difference of two numbers represented by two arrays and print the arrays. a2 - a1</li>
<li>Assumption - number represented by a2 is greater.</li>
